# Spotify End-To-End Data Engineering Projet

## Overview
This project involves building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using AWS services to collect and process data from Spotify playlists. The goal is to automate the extraction of music data, transform it into structured formats, and store it in AWS for further analysis and insights. The data is organized into separate tables for albums, artists, and tracks.
